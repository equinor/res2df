.. py:function:: getLogger_res2csv(module_name: str = 'res2df', args_dict: dict[str, str | bool] | None = None) -> logging.Logger

   Provide a custom logger for res2csv and csv2res

   Logging output is by default split by logging levels (split between WARNING and
   ERROR) to stdout and stderr, each log occurs in only one of the streams.
   This deviates from Unix standard, but is accepted here because the code
   often writes it main output to a dedicated filename.

   :param module_name: A suggested name for the logger, usually
                       __name__ should be supplied
   :param args_dict: Dictionary with contents from the argparse namespace object.
                     Only keys "output", "verbose" and "debug" will be looked at.
                     Use vars(args) in caller code to convert from argparse Namespace object.
