.. py:function:: ert_plugin(name: str = '') -> collections.abc.Callable[[collections.abc.Callable[P, Any]], collections.abc.Callable[P, Any]]

.. py:class:: Res2Csv

   Bases: :py:obj:`ert.ForwardModelStepPlugin`


   Holds information to execute one step of a forward model

   .. attribute:: executable

      The name of the executable to be run

   .. attribute:: stdin_file

      File where this forward model step's stdin is written

   .. attribute:: stdout_file

      File where this forward model step's stdout is written

   .. attribute:: stderr_file

      File where this forward model step's stderr is written

   .. attribute:: target_file

      Name of file expected to be produced after the forward
      model step is executed successfully.
      This file is used for the legacy ERT queue driver, and may be deprecated.

   .. attribute:: error_file

      Name of file expected to be produced after a forward
      model step errors.
      This file is used for the legacy ERT queue driver, and may be deprecated.

   .. attribute:: start_file

      Name of file expected to be produced upon start of
      a forward model step's execution.
      This file is used for the legacy ERT queue driver, and may be deprecated.

   .. attribute:: max_running_minutes

      Maximum runtime in minutes. If the forward model step
      takes longer than this, the step is requested to be cancelled.

   .. attribute:: min_arg

      The minimum number of arguments

   .. attribute:: max_arg

      The maximum number of arguments

   .. attribute:: arglist

      The arglist with which the executable is invoked

   .. attribute:: required_keywords

      Keywords that are required to be supplied by the user

   .. attribute:: arg_types

      Types of user-provided arguments, this list must have indices
      corresponding to the number of args that are user specified
      and thus also subject to substitution.

   .. attribute:: environment

      Dictionary representing environment variables to inject into the
      environment of the forward model step run

   .. attribute:: default_mapping

      Default values for optional arguments provided by the user.
      For example { "A": "default_A" }

   .. attribute:: private_args

      A dictionary of user-provided keyword arguments.
      For example, if the user provides <A>=2, the dictionary will contain
      { "A": "2" }


   .. py:method:: validate_pre_experiment(fm_json: ert.ForwardModelStepJSON) -> None

      Raise errors pertaining to the environment not being
      as the forward model step requires it to be. For example
      a missing FLOW version.



   .. py:method:: documentation() -> ert.ForwardModelStepDocumentation | None
      :staticmethod:


      Returns the documentation for the plugin forward model
