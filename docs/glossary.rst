    deck/input deck
        Inputs provided to reservoir simulators such as Eclipse or OPM Flow.
        Usually a .DATA file pointing to other include files. One deck
        typically points to multiple include files.

    include files
        Files that provide inputs to reservoir simulators by using the INCLUDE statement
        in input decks. By convention, these files often have the extension .INC (generally)
        or .GRDECL (for files included into the grid section).
