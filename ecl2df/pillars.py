    This is the "main" function for Python API users
    Produces a dataframe with data for each I-J combination
    (in the column PILLAR), and if a region parameter is
    supplied, also pr. region.

    PORV is the summed porevolume of the pillar (in the region),
    VOLUME is bulk volume, and PORO is porevolume weighted porosity
    PERM columns contain unweighted value averages, use with caution.

    If a restart date is picked, then SWAT and SGAS will
    be used to compute volumes pr. phase, WATVOL, OILVOL and GASVOL. The
    columns with dynamic data will include the date in the column headers
    like SWAT@2009-01-01

    Args:
        region: A parameter the pillars will be split
            on. Typically EQLNUM or FIPNUM. Set to empty string
            or None to avoid any region grouping.
        rstdates: Dates for which restart data
            is to be extracted. The string can
            be in ISO-format, or one of the mnenomics
            'first', 'last' or 'all'. It can also be a list
            of datetime.date.
        soilcutoff: If not None, an oil-water contact will
            be estimated pr. pillar, based on the deepest cell with
            SOIL above the given cutoff. Value is put in column OWC.

            estimated pr pillar, based on the deepest cell with
            SGAS above the given cutoff. Value is put in column GOC.
        swatcutoff: OWC or GWC is only computed for pillars
            where at least one cell is above this value.
        stackdates: If true, a column
            called DATE will be added and data for all restart
